# CPU scheduling an page replacement algorithm simulation in Python

## Process scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS: First Come First Serve
- SJF: Shortest Job First (Non-preemptive)

## Page replacement algorithms:
- FIFO: First In First Out
- LRU: Least Recenly Use

### How to run?
Clone the code to your machine and create create necessary folders (if needed; you can also delete files I've put there and go from there).
Then run main.py (you can change varaibles through command line -> for more info run main.py -h or main.py --help)


Feel free to reuse my code as you want!
